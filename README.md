# CSE360-Group-Tu27
Group Tuesday 27's Project Github Repository

To-do:

- Improved/Nicer homepage once role is selected and logged in
- Adding Database with JDBC (probably with sqlite?)

Recently added:
- "Reset Password" functionality. An admin can now reset a user's password and send them a one-time password with an expiration date of 24 hours.
- Users are now correctly routed to the home page, or role selection page if they have multiple roles.
